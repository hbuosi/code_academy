First off, we need to know how much it costs to ship a package of given weight by normal ground shipping.

#function about the Ground weight and cost
def weight_cost_ground(weight):
  if weight <= 2:
    price_per_pound = 1.50
  elif weight <= 6:
    price_per_pound = 3.00
  elif weight <= 10:
    price_per_pound = 4.00
  else:
    price_per_pound = 4.75
 #The problem gave inside the table that: flat charge is $ 20 for Ground
  return 20 + (price_per_pound * weight)

#testing the function
print(weight_cost_ground(8.4))

#The problem gave me that: Premium Shipping is a flat value $ 125.00
shipping_cost_premium = 125.00

#function about the Drone weight and cost
def weight_cost_drone(weight):
  if weight <= 2:
    price_per_pound = 4.50
  elif weight <= 6:
    price_per_pound = 9.00
  elif weight <= 10:
    price_per_pound = 12.00
  else:
    price_per_pound = 14.25

#The problem gave inside the table that: flat charge is $ 20 for Drone
  return price_per_pound * weight

print(weight_cost_drone(1.5))

# This function define how type of messagem the users will see
def print_cheapest_shipping_method(weight):

#variable create
  ground = weight_cost_ground(weight)
  premium = shipping_cost_premium
  drone = weight_cost_drone(weight)

#conditional statement
  if ground < premium and ground < drone:
    method = "standard ground"
    cost = ground
  elif premium < ground and premium < drone:
    method = "premium ground"
    cost = premium
  else:
    method = "drone"
    cost = drone

#message personalized using trick % () for call variable
  print(
    "The cheapest option available is $%.2f with %s shipping."
    % (cost, method)
  )

#test function
print_cheapest_shipping_method(4.8)
print_cheapest_shipping_method(41.5)
